## Code Overview
There are 3 main parts of the code - user interface, background script, and injection script. The user interface is a simple but neat form that provides the user with information with their settings and what configuration it looks like. The background script stores the form information and transfers the settings to the injection script. The injection script takes the background script form information and blocks the nessecary elements that the user has selected.
